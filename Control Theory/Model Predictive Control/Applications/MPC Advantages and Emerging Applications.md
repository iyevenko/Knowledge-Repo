# Model Predictive Control

## Introduction
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a control strategy that uses a mathematical model of the system to predict its future behavior and optimize a control action over a finite time horizon. MPC is widely used in various applications, including vehicle path planning and control, process control, robotics, and more.

## Advantages of MPC
- MPC can handle constraints on the system inputs and outputs.
- MPC can handle nonlinear systems and systems with time-varying dynamics.
- MPC can handle systems with disturbances and uncertainties.
- MPC can optimize a control action over a finite time horizon, which can lead to better performance than traditional control strategies.

## Applications of MPC
- Vehicle path planning and control
  - MPC can handle nonlinear vehicle models and world models.
  - MPC can use a receding horizon preview to plan a trajectory for the vehicle.
- Process control
  - MPC can handle constraints on the process inputs and outputs.
  - MPC can optimize a control action over a finite time horizon to improve the process performance.
- Robotics
  - MPC can handle constraints on the robot inputs and outputs.
  - MPC can optimize a control action over a finite time horizon to improve the robot performance.

## History of MPC
- MPC was first proposed in the 1970s.
- MPC has been widely studied and applied in various fields since then.
- Emerging MPC applications include microgrid control, building energy management, and more.

## Practical Considerations for MPC
- Model predictive controller design
  - Choose an appropriate model of the system.
  - Choose an appropriate cost function to optimize.
  - Choose an appropriate solver to solve the optimization problem.
- Code implementation
  - Implement the MPC algorithm in a programming language such as Python or MATLAB.
- System setup
  - Set up the system to measure the relevant variables and actuate the relevant inputs.
- Simulation of the system
  - Simulate the system with the MPC algorithm to evaluate its performance.
- Tradeoffs
  - Choose appropriate tradeoffs between performance, computational complexity, and implementation complexity.
