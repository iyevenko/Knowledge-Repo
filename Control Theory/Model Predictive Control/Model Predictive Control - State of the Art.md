# Model Predictive Control - State of the Art in HVAC Field

## Overview
- Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a control algorithm that uses the model of the plant to anticipate future states of the system.
- The scheme is also feedback control and can perform online optimizations.
- A significant amount of energy consumption in buildings comes from the cooling and heating system, making it a promising candidate for carbon emission reduction.
- Energy management in building HVAC systems is crucial in the search for solutions related to global energy demand.
- Implementing control techniques in HVAC systems faces several challenges, including dynamical behavior of the system, uncertainty in disturbance predictions, practical feasibility and applicability, integration of renewable energy systems, and non-linearity and complexity of HVAC systems.

## Classical vs. Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- Classical approaches, such as PIDs, are practical but focus only on indoor environment conditioning rather than efficient control approaches.
- In contrast, MPC is a promising candidate for smart buildings, efficient control, higher energy savings, and better indoor environment.
- MPC is an advanced form of a control strategy for process control, consisting of a plant model, optimizer solver, and a prediction horizon for generating control trajectory for the process.
- MPC has various technical specialties and features making it one of the prominent choices for control strategies in building systems.

## Benefits of MPC
- MPC is a suitable and the best candidate when it comes to questioning for future predictions in terms of energy efficiency, cost, and control mechanisms.
- MPC is an optimization-based control technique that aims to drive the closed-loop system to an optimal operation set-point while meeting state, input.
- Over 2000 industrial installations with MPC have been the most widely implemented technique in process control strategies.
- The effectiveness of MPC increases while considering thermal energy storage such as passive building thermal mass or active systems such as ice and chilled water storage.
