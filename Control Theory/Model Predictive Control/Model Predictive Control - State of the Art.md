# Model Predictive Control - State of the Art

## Overview
- Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a control algorithm that uses the model of the plant to anticipate future states of the system.
- The scheme is also feedback control and can perform online optimizations.

## Benefits of MPC
- MPC is a suitable and the best candidate when it comes to questioning for future predictions in terms of energy efficiency, cost, and control mechanisms.
- MPC is an optimization-based control technique that aims to drive the closed-loop system to an optimal operation set-point while meeting state, input.
