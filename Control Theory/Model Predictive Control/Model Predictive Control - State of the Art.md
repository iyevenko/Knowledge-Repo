[7] ### Key Points
- MPC determines the control law implicitly by solving a potentially constrained optimization problem.
- MPC shifts the effort for the design of a controller towards modeling of the to-be-controlled process.
- MPC can control systems that cannot be controlled by conventional feedback controllers.
- This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the latest developments, historic evolution, and practical considerations of MPC.
- The article lays special attention on applications and provides a detailed discussion on implementation details and strategies to cope with the computational burden.
- The article points to the future trends emphasizing why they are the next logical steps in MPC.

[9] ## Introduction to Model Predictive Control

[10] ### Lecture on Model Predictive Control
- Lecture X from Stanford University on Model Predictive Control

[11] ### Resource on Industrial MPC Algorithms
- Joe Qin's survey of industrial MPC algorithms

[12] ### Conceptual Idea of MPC
- MPC is a control algorithm that uses a model of the plant to anticipate future states of the system.
- The scheme is also feedback control and can perform online optimizations.

[13] ### Current Use of MPC in Optimal Control Synthesis
- MPC is an optimization-based control technique that aims to drive the closed-loop system to an optimal operation set-point while meeting state, input.

[14] ### Example: Lateral Control of a Car
- MPC can be used for lateral control of a car, where the objective is to keep the car in the center of the lane while minimizing lateral deviation and control effort.

[15] ### Advantages of MPC
- MPC is a powerful control scheme with many applications in industry and beyond.

[16] ## Receding Horizon Control

[17] ### History and Industrial Application
- Receding Horizon Control (RHC) is a type of MPC that has been used in industry since the 1970s.
- RHC is a popular control scheme for systems with fast dynamics and constraints.

[18] ### Emerging Applications
- RHC is being used in emerging applications such as autonomous vehicles and renewable energy systems.

[19] ### State-based MPC
- State-based MPC is a variant of MPC that uses a state estimator to estimate the current state of the system.

[20] ## Industrial MPC

[21] ### Lecture on Industrial MPC
- Lecture 15 from Stanford University on Industrial MPC

[22] ### Comparison to Other Control Schemes
- Industrial MPC is compared to other control schemes such as PID control and LQR control.

[23] ## Conclusion

- RHC is a popular variant of MPC that has been used in industry since the 1970s.
- State-based MPC is a variant of MPC that uses a state estimator to estimate the current state of the system.
