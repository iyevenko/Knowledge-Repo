## Model Predictive Control - An Overview

### Introduction
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a control strategy that uses a mathematical model of the system to predict future behavior and optimize control inputs. It is widely used in various applications such as robotics, process control, and autonomous vehicles.

### Variants of MPC
There are several variants of MPC, including:
- Linear MPC
- Nonlinear MPC
- Constrained MPC
- Distributed MPC
- Stochastic MPC

### Applications of MPC
MPC has been successfully applied in various fields, such as:
- Robotics
- Process control
- Autonomous vehicles
- Aerospace
- Energy management

### Comparison to Other Control Schemes
MPC has several advantages over other control schemes, such as:
- Ability to handle constraints
- Ability to handle nonlinear systems
- Ability to handle time-varying systems
- Ability to handle disturbances
- Ability to optimize control inputs

### MPC Implementation Example
Currently, a "Google Chrome" window titled "MPC-Implementation/Race Trajectory 1.py at main  devsonni/MPC-Implementation  GitHub" is open on the computer. The window displays a Python implementation of MPC for a race trajectory. The implementation uses the CasADi library and includes functions for shifting the time step, converting between CasADi and NumPy arrays, and generating data for a cylinder along the z-axis.
