# Evolutionary Algorithm Scaling

## Introduction
Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are optimization algorithms that use mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. EAs have been applied to various optimization problems, including multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), large-scale optimization problems, and medical problems.
