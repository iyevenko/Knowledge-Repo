# Evolutionary Computation and Open-Ended Learning Problems

## Introduction
Evolutionary Computation (EC) is a class of algorithms used to solve open-ended learning problems in Artificial Intelligence. Traditionally, these algorithms evolve fixed-length genomes to encode solutions. However, many common structures are defined by an indefinite number of parameters, making it difficult to estimate the appropriate number of genes to encode such structures.

## NEAT-Python
NEAT-Python is an implementation of the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm in Python. NEAT allows for the evolution of neural networks with varying numbers of connections and nodes, making it a useful tool for solving problems with complex structures.

## Novelty Search
Novelty Search is a technique used in EC to encourage the discovery of novel solutions rather than just optimizing existing ones. This approach can be particularly useful in fields such as engineering, finance, and healthcare where finding new and innovative solutions is crucial.

## Diversity in Population
Research suggests that allowing for diversity in the population during evolution can lead to the discovery and improvement of complex solutions. Therefore, EC algorithms should be allowed to complexify as well as optimize.

Overall, EC algorithms such as NEAT-Python and Novelty Search can be powerful tools for solving open-ended learning problems in a variety of fields.
