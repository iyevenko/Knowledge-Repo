# Optimized Collision Free Robot Move Statement Generation by the Evolutionary Software GLEAM

## Abstract
The GLEAM algorithm is a new evolutionary method application in the field of robotics that generates control code for real industrial robots. It allows for a time-related description of robot movement and maps internal representations of primitive move commands to a representation of move statements of an industrial robot language.
